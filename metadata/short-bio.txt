Wolfgang Jeltsch came into contact with functional programming as an
undergraduate and has been using it extensively in research,
development, and teaching ever since. For many years he pursued research
on functional reactive programming (FRP), in particular about its
efficient and type-safe implementation, its semantics, and its close
connection to temporal logic. Currently he is working on high-assurance
implementations of blockchain consensus protocols based on Haskell and
Isabelle/HOL.

He earned a PhD in computer science from Brandenburg University of
Technology, Cottbus in 2012. He is part of Well-Typed, working as a
consultant for blockchain company IOHK.
